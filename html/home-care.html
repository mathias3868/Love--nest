              >Elderly care encompasses a broad range of services and support
              aimed at meeting the physical, emotional, and social needs of
              older adults. As individuals age, they may require assistance with
              activities of daily living, healthcare, social engagement, and
              emotional support.
            </p>

            <p
              >Elderly care is dedicated support that addresses the physical and
              mental needs of people as they age. It can include short-term
              assistance to recover from a specific condition, respite care to
              give unpaid carers a break, or long-term support. Elderly care can
              include a range of services tailored to the individual and their
              specific situation - from helping them maintain a healthy and
              nutritious diet, to encouraging gentle and positive movement.
              Elderly care can help individuals maintain a positive quality of
              life during their later years.</p

            <h3>what is the importance of Elderly care</h3>
            <p
              >The world is aging faster than ever before. According to the
              Centre for Aging Better, there are currently 11 million people
              aged 65 in England alone, and this is set to rise to 13 million in
              the next 10 years.
            </p>
            <p
              >The ageing process does not always lead to disability, although
              86 percent of people over 85 are living with at least one chronic
              long-term health condition. It's projected that the number of
              individuals in care in the UK will double by 2035, meaning care
              services are gaining increased importance. The use of their
              services enables our loved ones to maintain independence and enjoy
              a longer quality of life.</p

            due health difficulties, mobility issues, or loneliness may find
            assistance and support through elderly care services. For example,
            those living with dementia, complex medical conditions like
            Parkinson's Disease, or finding it difficult to keep up with
            personal care may see their quality of life improve with
            professional support.</p

          <p
            >it should be noted that an older person may not always be aware of
            when they require assistance. This can be challenging for friends
            and family members to observe and therefore needs a sensitive
            approach. We have some advice for discussing sensitive topics from a
            professional therapist here.</p
